# SearchBarReactNative + Apollo

This is a code example of the use of Apollo.

In this application we have an Input Text as a search box. When we write some artist name in the input text a list of artists with that name is shown.
The list shows us an image picture and a artist name.

We are using the public graphql api: https://spotify-graphql-server.herokuapp.com/graphql

APollo library: https://www.apollographql.com/

The result of this code is the next screen:
